# DJ System Using OSC and Pure Data

## Team Members
- Nicole Molineros S.

## Project Description
This project implements a DJ system using **OSC Controller (Open Sound Control)** and the **Pure Data (PD)** programming language. The DJ system allows users to interact with different widgets (sliders and buttons) from the OSC layout, each producing an auditory response in Pure Data, simulating the performance of a DJ. The project enables the creation of electronic music tracks through real-time manipulation of sound parameters.

To achieve this, I used **MobMuPlat** to connect OSC controls with Pure Data, creating a seamless and interactive environment where every touch or slide changes the audio output dynamically. The system is capable of creating live music performances where each widget directly impacts the audio signal, transforming it in real-time.

## Requirements
- The app **OSC Controller** and **Pure Data** must be used for communication and audio processing.
- All widgets from the OSC layout (sliders and buttons) must be utilized in the project.
- Each widget interaction must produce a unique auditory response in Pure Data, allowing for the generation of electronic music in DJ style.
- A video demonstration showing the functionality of the system.

## Justification 

I decided to use **MobMuPlat** to bridge the OSC interactions with Pure Data because it provides an intuitive interface for managing OSC messages and creating customized controls for real-time sound manipulation. This setup allows for real-time feedback and control, making it ideal for a DJ-style system where interaction speed and responsiveness are key.
Each widget was programmed to affect different parameters of the audio, including pitch, tempo, and filter, ensuring that users can create complex and dynamic soundscapes with minimal effort. The system was designed with simplicity in mind, so even those unfamiliar with Pure Data can easily interact with the interface and start creating music right away.
