## DJ System Using OSC and Pure Data

## Project Description
This project implements a DJ system using **OSC Controller (Open Sound Control)** and the **Pure Data (PD)** programming language. The DJ system allows users to interact with different widgets (sliders and buttons) from the OSC layout, each producing an auditory response in Pure Data, simulating the performance of a DJ. The project enables the creation of electronic music tracks through real-time manipulation of sound parameters.

To achieve this, I used **MobMuPlat** to connect OSC controls with Pure Data, creating a seamless and interactive environment where every touch or slide changes the audio output dynamically. The system is capable of creating live music performances where each widget directly impacts the audio signal, transforming it in real-time.
